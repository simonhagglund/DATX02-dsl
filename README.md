# DSL - Bachelor Thesis

Following [DSLsofMath](https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath), we want to write a learning material teaching [Control Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory).
This project was a part of a bachelor thesis project at Chalmers University of Technology. 

The group members were: 
- Jakob Fihlman
- Simon Hägglund
- Christian Josefson
- Filip Nylander
- Elin Ohlman
- Tommy Räjert 


The thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/simonhagglund/DATX02-dsl/blob/master/rapport.pdf), 
and the latest version of the learning material can be found  [here](https://github.com/simonhagglund/DATX02-dsl-produkt).
